      <h1>Our goal is to engage communities to care deeply for their local aquatic habitats</h1>

  <p>Water is the basis of all life on earth.</p>

  <p>With more than 85% of Australians living on the edge of our 25,000km coastline, and as a continent where fresh water is scarce and precious, our relationship with water is profound. Not surprisingly, the challenges faced by communities and nature in those places are significant, and they need active stewardship to ensure that they function as best they can.</p>

  <p>We work with communities, governments and industry partners to provide that stewardship at wetlands and coastal locations across the country.</p>

  <p>We do this through our four Revive initiatives:</p>

  <h1>Revive our Rivers</h1>

  <p>Because on the driest inhabited continent on Earth, healthy, functioning rivers are crucial.</p>

  <p>Australia’s rivers are of immense ecological significance and provide important habitat for many species. Our rivers, their catchments and floodplains support significant aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity, including species found nowhere else on Earth. Maintaining healthy connections between oceans, rivers and their floodplains is critical for the life cycle of many species.</p>

  <p>Revive our Rivers engages communities to protect and enhance our rivers, floodplains and catchments to ensure they are clean and healthy for future generations.</p>

  <h1>Revive our Coasts</h1>

  <p>Because 85% of Australian live within 50km of the coast and this places enormous pressure on our coastal environments.</p>

  <p>As an island continent, Australia’s coastline is vast, and encompasses many different habitats and ecosystems which provide habitat throughout the life cycle of many resident and migratory species. Beaches, rock platforms and sand dunes are all important habitat for many species, and the coast is intimately linked to our cultural identify and way of life.</p>

  <p>Revive our Coasts engages communities to protect and enhance our remaining wetlands to ensure they function as best they can into the future.</p>

  <h1>Revive our Oceans</h1>

  <p>Because every minute of every day, the equivalent of 1 garbage truckload of plastics enters our oceans.</p>

  <p>Our oceans are home to around 80% of life on earth, with half of the world’s biodiversity found below its surface. Australia’s oceans house ecosystems of scale and diversity found nowhere else on earth.</p>

  <p>One of the most pervasive threats to life below water is ocean litter, and it is entering our oceans at an alarming rate and it is harming wildlife who become entangled in it, or mistake it for food.</p>

  <p>Revive our Oceans engages communities to stop plastics and other litter entering our oceans by stopping it at the source.</p>

  <h1>Revive our Wetlands</h1>

  <p>Because wetland ecosystems face significant pressure from urbanisation and other human induced impacts.</p>

  <p>Wetlands, saltmarshes, and estuaries are some of the most productive ecosystems on the planet and provide critical habitat for many species. They are crucial feeding, breeding and roosting habitats for many native and migratory species, they provide important nursery environments for many species of fish and marine life, they improve water quality by intercepting and filtering land-driven pollution and nutrient, they sequester carbon, and play an important role in water and food security and flood and storm surge mitigation.</p>

  <p>Australia is the driest inhabited continent on the planet and water is vital, yet we have already lost more than 50% of our wetlands.</p>

  <p>Revive our Wetlands engages communities to protect and enhance our remaining wetlands to ensure they function as best they can into the future.</p>
